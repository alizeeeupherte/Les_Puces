### Boulevard Périphérique

![](image3D_1.png?raw=true)


The project involves switching to several scales on the Boulevard Périphérique. At the scale of the metropolis, the challenge remains to limit the place of the car. On our trunk it would represent 1/4 of the current wideyr of the tracks is 9 meters. 

Our objective was to intervene punctually on the Peripheral Boulevard to create a weaving and a connection between Paris and its suburbs. The development on this new urban boulevard is to develop or to live, small demountable structures. Ephemeral or not, we want to mark the site in an evolutionary way. The system can thus multiply or fade easily on the urban boulevard, that it does not remain only a way dedicated to the circulation with some infrastructures on it.

### Porte de Clignancourt

On the scale of our site, the Porte de Clignancourt, we wanted to create a crossing of this urban boulevard located 10m above the city. This building also wanted to be the icon, the landmark of these chips that we struggled to really delimit. With different programs within the same building, the idea was to meet different needs of users of the place. Exhibition space, market, auction room, restaurant with roof top terrace. To give it more visibility, we wanted to dig the ring road to bring more light to our building.
